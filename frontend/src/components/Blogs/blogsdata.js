    desc: "Many relevant studies show that consumers’ demand for healthier and sustainable food is growing. Consumers have become conscious and demanding, they want to have confidence in the processes and actors that are involved in the lifecycle of food products. Thus, consumer trust in food is crucial to the transformation of the food system, and the agri-food industry needs to improve transparency which would enable consumers to make more informed choices about the health, safety, and sustainability of their food. Although consumers’ trust in the food system is slightly growing, based on the latest EIT Food Trust Report from 2021, there is still more work to be done. The study found that consumers acknowledge that many companies are actively trying to adjust to consumer needs but, they want retailers and manufacturers to be clearer on their criteria for food products and increase their supply chain transparency at the same time. Thus, utilizing digital technologies can increase food transparency, grow companies’ reputations, and maintain customers’ trust in the food they eat. The food traceability technology market is fundamental to improving food safety, providing a method of tracking, tracing, and documenting the journey of food items through the supply chain.Here are the 4 key reasons why traceability matters to food and retail companies. Traceability enhances supply chain visibility and efficiency Traceability was once a simple process where local farmers and markets were trusted by small villages and towns, but in the globalized world, as we know it today, food brands and corporates now face the challenge of producing for the mass market while maintaining the integrity and consumer trust.  Long and complex supply chains lead to a lack of visibility which presents more risks of food-borne illnesses, such as E. coli, listeria, and salmonella. Traceability technology can help companies identify the source, location, and ownership of food products as they move through the supply chain, making it easier to track and trace contaminated items and enabling businesses to ensure that their products remain safe and of high quality.  Traceability ensures transparency by sharing information about the production and processing of food directly with consumers. Due to the growing awareness of issues about food safety and the expanding desire for certified product origin, through technological and innovative advances, traceability aims to ensure customer confidence. Traceability technology can be used to transparently share information on the origin of food products so that customers can make more informed decisions about the food they buy and consume. Whether it be evidence surrounding health and sustainability claims, food safety, or product authenticity, traceability technology provides customers with evidenced information about food products to improve trust. It can also lead to enhancing companies’ reputation and allows companies to communicate their commitment to sustainability, ethical sourcing, and responsible production practices, which can be a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Traceability enables companies to showcase compliance with growing regulations As the food traceability industry continues to grow, governments worldwide are increasing their regulation of the sector to ensure food safety. Traceability is essential for complying with these regulations. By maintaining accurate records of the origins and movement of products, companies can demonstrate their commitment to compliance and avoid costly fines and legal consequences. Traceability servers as a risk-management tool that allows companies to withdraw or recall unsafe foodTraceability helps identify the source of products and ingredients in the supply chain and quickly respond to food safety issues. In the event of a food safety issue or product recall, companies can quickly pinpoint affected batches, minimizing the scope of the problem and protecting consumers from potentially harmful products. This ensures that food products meet safety and quality standards, reducing the risk of liability and damage to a company’s reputation.  ",

    desc: "For over a decade, Jose has cultivated a thriving pineapple crop in the picturesque landscapes of Costa Rica. However, two years ago, he embarked on a transformative journey by implementing AGRIVI Farm Management Software. His goal? To consolidate all vital operations onto one centralized platform where he could record and access data, plan his pineapple seasons, perform weekly plans, and have a daily overview of tasks and budget.Before this digital transformation, Jose dealt with some familiar challenges. Tracking farm operations data, accessing real-time information, and gaining a precise overview of production costs were some of the usual challenges he faced. Moreover, all operations on his farm were managed through Excel spreadsheets, so it was difficult to manage everything efficiently since he didn’t have information in real time. Driven by the recurrent challenges of each season, Jose recognized the need for a digital solution that would provide him with precise and intelligent data for improved efficiency and profitability. After two years of implementing AGRIVI Farm Enterprise platform, Jose records tangible improvements in his farm work management. Among the key benefits he experienced were enhanced time management, the ability to oversee all farm operations, and the capability to monitor planned versus actual activities, facilitating timely decision-making when required. Nowhere is this improvement more evident than in his approach to planning pineapple seasons.  As a part of season preparation, Jose creates a season template that outlines all activities necessary for his crop, along with the tasks associated with each activity, prioritizing them according to timing, which saves time and makes data recording easier when the season begins. This comprehensive template encompasses everything from soil tillage and fertilization to scouting and harvesting. Thanks to this, Jose now has a precise overview of his planned activities and their scheduled timelines, allowing him to delegate farm work management responsibilities to his farm manager. Within the AGRIVI Work Order module his farm manager, creates, assigns, and monitors tasks in real-time, ensuring that the entire team remains organized and on track with their to-do lists. Moreover, within the planned part of the Work Orders, he can prepare daily, weekly, or monthly plans during the entire season. Leveraging the detailed insights and reporting features within the AGRIVI platform, the farm manager can analyze the team’s productivity and optimize the farm’s workflow effectively. Overview of Budget vs. Actual One of the very convenient benefits of working in AGRIVI FMS is that Jose can define his crop production budget for the whole season and define amounts and prices for each item he is planning to use during the season. Budget vs. Actual feature then allows him to maintain a timely grasp of his budget’s status, enabling him to analyze whether his initial plan aligns with the reality on the ground. With these insights, he can make data-driven decisions promptly and even forecast the budget for the upcoming season based on the current season’s performance.This is especially convenient in overcoming cost hikes and inflation challenges due to the global macroeconomic situation. With the help from AGRIVI FMS, he can for example optimize and reduce his input usage based on the planned activities and needs from the field, and then make savings in his total planned budget. Upon completing the final planned activity of his latest pineapple season, Jose embarks on a comprehensive performance analysis. The ability to create a season template and track all activities and budgets within a centralized platform empowers him to analyze all aspects of overall productivity. As the season concludes, Jose reviews the consumption of various agricultural materials, to see what amounts were spent and remaining supplies so he can plan and purchase materials for the next season. He also examines the hours and performance of workers in each field, which provides valuable insights into the farm’s overall efficiency. Additionally, the Field Analytics feature allows him to analyze the yield per field. Thanks to this feature he discovered that one field had a lower yield than others, so he could analyze what caused it. He could analyze the amount of fertilizers and crop protection products he used, water usage, and overall productivity.  Based on this data-driven insight he can improve the plan and activities for the next season. With insights drawn from the concluded season, Jose can revise activities and tasks that did not meet expectations in the new season templates, with the ultimate goal of achieving higher yields and reducing costs.This story is just an example of how implementing farm management software empowers farmers to optimize their crop production and make their farms more efficient.
